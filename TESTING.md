### Testing UX Stories

* As a user who enjoys Rick and Morty, I want to test my knowledge at a Rick and Morty quiz, I can attempt the quiz on the main page
  * The user can simply find the "Start Quiz" button on the main page and begin the quiz.
  * The quiz is easy to use and only requires clicking the desired option
* As a user who enjoys social meet-ups, I want to meet new people, I can find out where the fans meet up on the club page
  * The user can navigate to the club page and find a map of where the meet up happens and then contact via the sign up form
* As a user who loves Rick and Morty, I want to be part of a fan club, I can sign up to the fan club on the club page.
  * The user can find a sign up form on the club page, where they can contact the club admin and request to join
* As the owner of the site, who also loves Rick and Morty, I can gain club members and eventually sell merchandise and organise events for the club
  * Once there is traffic on the site and users apply to join the club, the owner will be able to create a data base of club members and customers for merchandise
